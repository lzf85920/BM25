<?xml version="1.0"?><data><abstract><p>Heightened concern over endocrine-disrupting chemicals is driven by the hypothesis that they could reduce reproductive success and affect wildlife populations, but there is little evidence for this expectation. The pharmaceutical ethynylestradiol (EE<sub>2</sub>) is a potent endocrine modulator and is present in the aquatic environment at biologically active concentrations. To investigate impacts on reproductive success and mechanisms of disruption, we exposed breeding populations (<italic>n</italic> = 12) of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) over multiple generations to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE<sub>2</sub>. Life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> in the F<sub>1</sub> generation caused a 56% reduction in fecundity and complete population failure with no fertilization. Conversely, the same level of exposure for up to 40 days in mature adults in the parental F<sub>0</sub> generation had no impact on reproductive success. Infertility in the F<sub>1</sub> generation after life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> was due to disturbed sexual differentiation, with males having no functional testes and either undifferentiated or inter-sex gonads. These F<sub>1</sub> males also showed a reduced vitellogenic response when compared with F<sub>0</sub> males, indicating an acclimation to EE<sub>2</sub> exposure. Depuration studies found only a partial recovery in reproductive capacity after 5 months. Significantly, even though the F<sub>1</sub> males lacked functional testes, they showed male-pattern reproductive behavior, inducing the spawning act and competing with healthy males to disrupt fertilization. Endocrine disruption is therefore likely to affect breeding dynamics and reproductive success in group-spawning fish. Our findings raise major concerns about the population-level impacts for wildlife of long-term exposure to low concentrations of estrogenic endocrine disruptors.</p></abstract><body><p>Major worldwide attention has focused on the possibility that disruption of reproductive systems by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may be affecting the reproductive health of wildlife populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0112-001725">Guillette and Gunderson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ehp0112-001725">Kime 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ehp0112-001725">Tyler et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-ehp0112-001725">Van Der Kraak 1998</xref>) and possibly, of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ehp0112-001725">Colborn and Clement 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ehp0112-001725">Ohtake et al. 2003</xref>).

Thus, given its concentration in the environment, EE<sub>2</sub> is potentially a major contributor to reproductive dysfunction in wild fish populations.</p><p>An overall aim of our research was to test whether there are any population-level consequences to reproductive dysfunction(s) induced by exposure to environmentally relevant levels of EDCs. Because of a number of compounding factors (e.g., larval dispersal, adult migration, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp0112-001725">Elliott et al. 2003</xref>) it is difficult to directly determine the population-level consequences of endocrine disruption on reproductive success in wild fish populations; even where it is possible to correlate levels of contamination with endocrine disruption and the consequential reproductive dysfunction with reproductive failure, this does not necessarily prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. For these reasons, one approach to understanding the population-level consequences of reproductive dysfunction is to measure the impact of pollutants on reproductive success in model species bred under laboratory conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp0112-001725">Balch et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0112-001725">Hill and Janz 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ehp0112-001725">Lange et al. 2001</xref>), an approach we have taken in our study. Reduced reproductive success may result from disruption of reproductive development, reduced female fecundity and male vitality, altered reproductive behavior, and/or disruption of the normal breeding dynamics. Little attention has been directed to the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp0112-001725">Balch et al. 2004</xref>). To fully assess the potential of EDCs to disrupt reproduction, multigenerational full life-cycle exposures are needed that consider all relevant life stages and developmental end points; even where fish have been exposed over their whole life-cycle, the impact of any resulting reproductive dysfunction on their reproductive output has mostly been overlooked in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ehp0112-001725">Metcalfe et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ehp0112-001725">Van den Belt et al. 2003</xref>). A major goal of this study was to determine which stages or reproductive components are relatively most sensitive to endocrine disruption in terms of population-level impairment or failure to allow better priority and focus for future studies. We therefore determined impacts on reproductive success in fish populations over multiple generations and the mechanisms of reproductive impairment/failure investigated using environmentally relevant concentrations of EE<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>. Our chosen species for this work was the zebrafish because its short generation time facilitates the life-long and multigenerational chemical exposures; it is a group-spawner (a common breeding system in fish); and, most importantly, small populations will spawn naturally in the laboratory without any manipulation.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Fish culture and husbandry.</title><p>Wild-type zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>, WIK strain; Max Plank Institute, Tubingen, Germany) maintained out-bred for three generations since capture were bred in our laboratory for one generation in clean freshwater before their use in this study.

The total reproductive success at 14 hpf was therefore the total number of viable embryos surviving to this stage. We used 14 hpf because infertile or dead embryos can be quickly differentiated from healthy embryos at this stage. Egg viability at 14 hpf was therefore a cumulative figure that includes the impact of unfertilized eggs plus embryo mortality during embryogenesis. Fertilization failure was differentiated from embryo mortality only in selected groups using time lapse videography to determine the mechanism(s) of reproductive failure.</p><p>At the begining of the study 720 adult (204 dpf) fish of mixed sex were randomly allocated to 60 aquaria (12 fish/aquarium) and acclimated for 14 days under egg collection conditions. Egg numbers and viability at 14 hpf were assessed in all groups in this F<sub>0</sub> generation for 5 days before starting exposures. Tanks for the 12 replicates of the five treatments were randomly allocated using Latin square randomization in both vertical and horizontal gradients, and all experimentation was run blind of treatments. Steroid treatments were then initiated by flushing aquaria with 36 L estrogen-treated water 1 hr after spawning (day 0), and reproductive success was assessed over the following 15 days. The surviving F<sub>1</sub> embryos were all reared to 100 hpf under continuous estrogen exposure, and the rate of embryo mortality/survival was assessed. We assessed the integrity of the surviving larvae, the proportion of embryos with developmental abnormalities, and the speed of development (proportion hatch and spine curvature) at 100 hpf as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ehp0112-001725">Kimmel et al.

The surviving F<sub>1</sub> embryos from these 3 days were then pooled within each replicate and reared to adulthood under continued exposure to form the F<sub>1</sub> exposure generation.

In the 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> treatment group, we found no phenotypic males, as discerned by the absence of any secondary sex characteristics, such as slightly yellow/bronze coloration and bright anal fin markings. This gave the initial impression that sex reversal had been induced, as occurs in some fish species after exposure to steroidal estrogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ehp0112-001725">Iwamatsu 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ehp0112-001725">Lange et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ehp0112-001725">Scholz and Gutzeit 2000</xref>). Further studies on these F<sub>1</sub> fish found that no fish contained expressible sperm. The hypothesis that reduced egg viability at 14 hpf was due to nonfertilization rather than early embryo mortality was confirmed through hourly time lapse image analyses of egg/embryo development for this treatment. Gonadal histology on the F<sub>1</sub> fish after life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> established that none of the males had normal testes. Of these fish, 43% had gonads that had not fully differentiated into testes; these undetermined gonads resembled primary stage ovary-type tissue, which is the natural condition of immature fish during early stages of normal male gonadal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ehp0112-001725">Maack and Segner 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0112-001725">Figure 4A</xref> shows an example. Gonadal evidence that these fish were indeed feminized males was further supported by the concentrations of blood VTG in these animals. Via histology, we found that all of these life-long exposed fish that were not clearly mature/maturing females had compromised gonads and also had very low concentrations of blood VTG (mean &#177; SEM = 1.8 &#177; 1.1 &#956;g/mL), whereas fish that were definitively females contained extremely high concentrations of blood VTG (1,092 &#177; 106 &#956;g/mL). We found no fish with an intermediate response. This highly dichotomous response to the estrogenic treatment after long-term exposure, which was strongly correlated to the histology and behavior&#8212;these dysfunctional males showed natural spawning behavior&#8212;gives good evidence these differential responses were determined by the underlying genetic sex. The interpretation that long-term exposure to estrogens suppresses male pattern sexual differentiation and arrests testes development rather than producing functional females is confirmed by earlier work on zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0112-001725">Hill and Janz 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ehp0112-001725">Segner et al. 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ehp0112-001725">Van den Belt et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0112-001725">Weber et al. 2003</xref>). In some of these earlier studies on zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0112-001725">Hill and Janz 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0112-001725">Weber et al. 2003</xref>), males with undifferentiated testes have been categorized as females and have been reported as a skewed sex ratio. This is a slightly misleading interpretation in an undifferentiated gonochorist species such as the zebrafish, because males that have arrested sexual differentiation, while superficially resembling early ovary type tissue (as do both sexes at this stage), do not develop into functional females and their gonads will differentiate into testes when removed from exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp0112-001725">Hill and Janz 2003</xref>). It would be more accurate to describe these fish as simply showing undetermined gonadal sex rather than assigning female status.</p><p>We found a low incidence of intersex gonads (four fish; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0112-001725">Figure 4B,C</xref>) in the 5 ng/L exposure group. Although similarly low occurrences of intersex have been found in various species when exposed to estrogens during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ehp0112-001725">Van den Belt et al. 2003</xref>), the high level of intersex found in some natural species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ehp0112-001725">Jobling et al. 1998</xref>) has not been replicated in the laboratory. This may relate to between-species differences in their susceptibility to this intersex condition or it could indicate the involvement of other, as yet, unknown chemical or environmental factors. It is doubtful if the fish with intersex gonads in our study were sexually functional because they also had extensive malformations of the ovarian and sperm ducts, as shown in other species [e.g., carp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp0112-001725">Gimeno and Komen 1996</xref>) and fathead minnow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ehp0112-001725">van Aerle et al. 2002</xref>)]; there was no fertilization in these groups.

Removing all the males from control tanks in the F<sub>1</sub> generation caused complete cessation of spawning, showing that the presence of males, or at least male pattern behavior, was needed to stimulate spawning in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0112-001725">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>When two healthy nonexposed males were taken from the control group and substituted for two males from populations previously exposed to 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> (six tanks), there was an increase in embryo viability, showing that the females in the 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> group were fertile. Even with healthy males, the rate of survival to 14 hpf was, however, significantly less than in the control group. This reduction in survival to 14 hpf was due to reduced fertilization success (tested using time-lapse videography) and indicates that the effects were not due to reduced egg quality in the EE<sub>2</sub>-exposed females. Experiments conducted in our laboratory have shown that even when the population sex ratio is strongly biased toward females in normal healthy populations (14 females:2 males), fertilization rates are &gt; 90%. Thus, the high level of unfertilized eggs in the 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> exposures with replacement males is unlikely to be a function of the presence of only two fertile males. Close observations of the spawning activity in these tanks revealed that sexually compromised males actively participated in the spawning act, chasing females and competing with the healthy males for proximity to the females as they spawned. Thus, it was clear that the reduced fertilization was, at least in part, due to infertile males interfering with the fertilization capability of healthy males. Egg production in the EE<sub>2</sub>-treated group with healthy males was higher when compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ehp0112-001725">Figure 5</xref>). The presence of vigorous, healthy males may have induced the greater egg production in these females after a prolonged period with EE<sub>2</sub>-exposed males. Moreover, egg production in this treatment group was similar to previous controls; egg production in the associated controls was relatively low.</p><p>The data from this experiment show that normal gonadal differentiation and development is relatively more sensitive to disruption than is male reproductive behavior. We suggest that there is a higher threshold on sensitivity to behavioral disruption relative to exposure concentrations that cause inhibition of functional testes development. Although few studies examine the impact of endocrine disruption on reproductive behavior in relation to reproduction success, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp0112-001725">Balch et al. (2004)</xref> confirmed that medaka behavior was unaffected at doses of EE<sub>2</sub> &lt; 10 ng/L, even though there were significant gonadal abnormalities at exposures of 2 ng/L.</p><p>Retention of a normal pattern of behavior in the infertile males that affects the fitness of other males may have an even greater impact on the reproductive success than if these males did not participate in spawning. The findings illustrate that information on the effects of EDCs and the interactions between fish within a spawning group (i.e., their mating systems) is necessary to develop our understanding of population-level implications of endocrine disruption. In the wild, group-spawning fish come together on a spawning ground; they may have migrated from different areas, and therefore different chemical exposure regimes, and thus they may have different degrees of disruption to their reproductive systems. To date, none of these factors has been taken into consideration when evaluating the potential impacts of EDCs such as EE<sub>2</sub> on breeding success in wild fish populations.</p><sec><title>Transgenerational effects, life stage sensitivity, and recovery from EE<sub>2</sub> exposure.</title><p>It is well documented that maternal transfer of the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol into the developing fetus in humans resulted in cases of sexual dysfunction, which became manifest at puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0112-001725">Bern 1992</xref>). Maternal transfer of EDCs may also occur in fish, when pollutants are co-transported with VTG into the developing oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp0112-001725">Gray et al. 1999</xref>). In the present study we found no transgenerational effects of F<sub>0</sub> exposure to &lt; 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> on the level of embryo viability at 14 hpf or F<sub>1</sub> embryo mortality and larval integrity (proportion of developmental abnormality, hatch rate, and level of spine curvature) at 100 hpf, when the offspring were reared in clean water and compared with the corresponding treatment in continuous F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> exposure or control treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 in all cases). This is not surprising because we also found no effects up to 100 hpf when both the parents (F<sub>0</sub>) and offspring (F<sub>1</sub>) were exposed at these same concentrations during the main multigenerational experiment. Moreover, reproductive success in the F<sub>1</sub> subgroups (<italic>n</italic> = 5) reared to adulthood in clean water but with parental F<sub>0</sub> exposure (0.5 and 5 ng/mL EE<sub>2</sub> and 5 ng/mL E<sub>2</sub>) was not affected, either in the number of eggs spawned by the F<sub>1</sub> (<italic>F</italic> = 1.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.39 <italic>n</italic> = 6) or the 14 hr viability of the resulting eggs (<italic>F</italic> = 0.84, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29; six tanks per treatment) when compared to the control eggs collected at the same time. This contrasts with continuous multigenerational exposures (F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub>) causing significant or complete reproductive failure at similar doses. F<sub>0</sub>-only exposure also had no consequences for the integrity of the F<sub>2</sub> offspring, either in the level of embryo mortality or larval integrity at 100 hpf (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 in all cases), again consistent with what would be expected if there were no transgenerational impact. These results, therefore, give little evidence of any transgenerational (maternal) effects of exposure to EE<sub>2</sub> or E<sub>2</sub>, at least when measuring population level consequences for reproductive success and survival. There are no other studies that have reported transgenerational effects of steroid hormones on reproductive success, although a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp0112-001725">Foran et al.

Even though males were still able to produce sperm (shown by stripping) and fertilize the eggs spawned by females, there was also persistent disruption to testes development, which could explain the reduced fertilization success. Histology showed extensive malformations of the sperm ducts, the presence of an ovarian cavity in the testis, variation in proportion of testicular cell types, and ciliation of sperm ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0112-001725">Figure 4D</xref>), a feature normally found in ovarian ducts that has been reported in wild intersex roach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ehp0112-001725">Nolan et al. 2001</xref>).

Partial recovery from EE<sub>2</sub> exposure during early sexual differentiation can therefore occur with a sufficient period of depuration, but certain morphologic effects are long lived. The persistent nature of EDC-induced gonadal abnormalities has been confirmed in several fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp0112-001725">Gimeno and Komen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ehp0112-001725">McAllister and Kime 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ehp0112-001725">Scholz and Gutzeit 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ehp0112-001725">van Aerle et al. 2002</xref>), and differences in the level of recovery after depuration probably relate to diverse modes of sexual differentiation found between species.</p></sec><sec><title>Vitellogenin and steroid hormone response.</title><p>In the F<sub>0</sub> generation after 40 days exposure to the lower, sublethal concentrations of EE<sub>2</sub>, we found a highly significant (<italic>F</italic> = 41.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and dose-related induction of VTG in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ehp0112-001725">Figure 6A</xref>). In males, a dose of only 0.5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> induced a 5,000-fold increase in blood VTG, which concurs with previous studies in fish, including zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0112-001725">Fenske et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ehp0112-001725">Thorpe et al. 2003</xref>). There was also a significant (<italic>F</italic> = 17.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 8) and dose-related suppression of the major male fish sex hormone 11-KT in F<sub>0</sub> males; in the blood of fish treated with 0.5, 5, or 50 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> or 5 ng/L E<sub>2</sub>, 11-KT concentrations were 30, 5, 6, and 8% of controls, respectively (mean &#177; SEM = 94 &#177; 46 ng/mL). The sensitivity of both VTG and 11-KT to exogenous steroidal estrogens reinforces their value as biomarkers for exposure to estrogen after short-term exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp0112-001725">Brion et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0112-001725">Denslow et al. 1999</xref>). Very considerable (3 orders of magnitude) changes in blood VTG and up to 95% reduction in 11-KT, however, did not impact the short-term reproductive success of the zebrafish populations, emphasizing their utility as biomarkers of estrogen exposure, rather than necessarily measures of reproductive impact. There were no significant impacts of the estrogen treatments on endogenous blood E<sub>2</sub>, although there was a high level of variability between fish. The measurements of 11-KT and E<sub>2</sub> are the first data on reproductive steroid hormones in zebrafish, and the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ehp0112-001725">Nash et al. 2000</xref>) could be adapted to other small species (&#8804;300 mg). To further investigate natural levels of a range of steroids in zebrafish and their response to endocrine disruption, ongoing research in our laboratories is examining a larger number of replicates that were collected in this study and in new experiments.</p><p>In contrast with the short-term adult exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ehp0112-001725">Figure 6A</xref>), we observed no induction of VTG in males after life-long exposure to &lt; 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ehp0112-001725">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting an acclimation to the EE<sub>2</sub> exposure. Similarly there were no effects of a multigenerational life-long exposure to estrogen on VTG in females, but the VTG concentration in F<sub>1</sub> controls was higher than in both the F<sub>0</sub> controls and 5 ng/L EE<sub>2</sub> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ehp0112-001725">Figure 6B</xref>). It seems likely that there is strong down-regulation of vitellogenic response after long-term exposure to exogenous estrogens, which has not been reported before. Studies in fish have shown that there are seasonal variations in the number of estrogen receptors and in the ligand affinity of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ehp0112-001725">Smith and Thomas 1991</xref>), and thus responsiveness to estrogen, but we do not know the mechanism for acclimation to estrogen observed here in males. A reduced vitellogenic response (or indeed lack of a response) in males after long-term exposure to low levels of estrogen further complicates the use of VTG as a biomarker for estrogen exposure in wild populations; fish that have been subjected to long-term exposure to estrogen and with no measurable blood VTG could still be reproductively compromised.</p><p>The temporal disassociation between the impact of estrogen exposure on reproductive success and the vitellogenic response also clearly shows that the perturbations to reproductive physiology that ultimately cause reproductive failure are probably not directly linked or at least not a direct consequence of the stimulation of vitellogenin.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our findings on the effective concentration of EE<sub>2</sub> on reproductive success raise serious concerns for possible population-level effects on fisheries. Concern about population-level consequences associated with exposure to EE<sub>2</sub> in the aquatic environment is further exacerbated by the fact that detection capabilities for routine assessments of EE<sub>2</sub> in effluents and environmental samples are generally above concentrations that are biologically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp0112-001725">Kolpin et al. 2002a</xref>). Extremely high potency and persistence in the aquatic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ehp0112-001725">Johnson and Williams 2004</xref>) is also likely to be mirrored by other persistent pharmaceuticals which are, as yet, not measured in routine assessments of effluents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ehp0112-001725">Metcalfe et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in this article give evidence that different reproductive components have differential sensitivities to endocrine disruption and that these sensitivities are dependent on the length of exposure and timing of exposure relative to development and maturity. Full life-long exposures had a strong impact on reproductive success at a concentration that was at least one order of magnitude less than when fish were given short-term exposures proximate to spawning. Conversely, after full life-long exposure there was no apparent stimulation of VTG in the F<sub>1</sub> adults, whereas short-term exposures strongly stimulated VTG in the parental F<sub>0</sub> generation at similar doses. These data have important implications for bodies devising effective methodologies for the diagnosis of the ecologic risk from endocrine disruptors and for those devising laboratory testing strategies for hazard assessment. Because it is the impacts at the population level that are ultimately of most concern, special care must be taken when interpreting the results from either short-term testing procedures or from biomarkers such as VTG. Although integrative long-term multigenerational studies are expensive and time consuming, the mechanistic information they produce is invaluable if we want to understand both the potential population consequences of endocrine disruption and the mode of action that leads to reproductive failure. Although these long-term studies cannot be repeated for every potential EDC, the mechanistic knowledge gained should be integrated into the design of shorter testing methodologies and new mechanistic approaches such as toxicogenomics, to allow for more accurate predictions of the population level consequences.</p><p>The value of an integrative approach can be clearly seen from the data obtained in our male replacement studies. A differential in relative sensitivity to disruption between gonadal and behavioral sexual differentiation had the consequence that male-pattern behavior was more robust to the effects of EE<sub>2</sub> exposure than was gonadal development, where exposure caused complete male infertility. If behavior is considered in isolation, then a lower impact on behavior may seem to have fewer population consequences; when behavior is considered in combination with infertility, it may actually increase the risk of reproductive failure in natural populations. We suggest that reproductive behavior plays a pivotal role in how chemically induced reproductive dysfunction(s) act to affect reproductive success and/or genetic integrity of populations. Moreover, there exists the possibility of other important interactions between endocrine disruption and mating systems that could strongly influence the population-level impact of reduced fertility. Sexual selection and mate choice strategies are complex, and endocrine disruption may interact or interfere with these in both negative and positive ways. Factors that determine the choice of a male by the female could, for example, be exaggerated in males with reduced fertility, giving these fish an even greater potential for interfering with the natural mating process and further increasing the impact of endocrine disruption on reproductive success. We suggest that further studies should examine this previously overlooked area.</p></sec></body></data>
