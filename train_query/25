   [**11-15**] treated with amiodarone. On [**2-20**], she was initially admitted
   through the ED with SOB and back pain, and was noted to have atrial
   fibrillation with RVR. A CTA demonstrating diffuse LAD and
   post-obstructive PNA concerning for malignancy. For her atrial
   fibrillation, she was started on diltiazem gtt, for which she was
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for monitoring. The atrial fibrillation was
   thought to be in the setting of a post-obstructive pneumonia, for which
   she was treated with antibiotics. She was then transferred to the floor
   later that same night on metoprolol 50 mg tid. While on the floor, she
   had a bronchoscopy performed which showed external compression of her
   left mainstem bronchus, and she had a biopsy/FNA performed, which
   showed large cell carcinoma. She was then readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**]
   yesterday with atrial fibrillation with HR 130s, and was started on a
   diltiazem gtt.
   .
   In the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**], she was started on po diltiazem, which was rapidly
   uptitrated to 60 mg qid. She was called out this morning. Tonight, at

    <description>A 64 yo female with with history of atrial fibrillation, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, repair of an atrial septum defect which was complicated by sternal wound infection and post-operative atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone, was initially admitted through the Emergency Department with shortness of breath and back pain, and was noted to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. A computed tomography angiography demonstrated diffuse left anterior descending artery and post-obstructive pneumonia concerning for malignancy. For her atrial fibrillation, she was started on diltiazem. For the pneumonia, she was treated with antibiotics. She was then transferred to the floor later that same night on metoprolol 50 mg tid. While on the floor, she had a bronchoscopy performed which showed external compression of her left mainstem bronchus, and she had a biopsy via fine-needle aspiration, which showed large cell carcinoma. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath and tachypnea. She does note some diaphoresis and occasional palpitations.</description>
