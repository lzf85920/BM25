   78 year old female with PMHx HTN, dCHF, Diabetes, CKD, Atrial
   fibrillation on coumadin, ischemic stroke, admitted after
   presenting to cardiology clinic today with confusion and
   Somnolence. Of note, she was recently discharged at the
   beginning of [**2876-4-14**] after presyncope/falls. At that time,
   lasix was stopped and atenolol was switched to metoprolol as
   there was concern that blunting of tachycardia could be
   contributing to falls. She was discharged to rehab (previously
   living at home).
   
   Per report from the ER, patient has had confusion at home x 3
   weeks, though no family accompanies her to corroborate this
   story, and patient denies this. The patient is not sure why she
   is in the hospital. She saw her cardiologist today, who
   referred her to the ER after she appeared to be dehydrated,
   somnolent, and confused.
