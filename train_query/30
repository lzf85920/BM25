   85 y/o F with PMHx of HTN, HL, h/o breast CA and 3cm renal pelvis
   transitional cell tumor who presented for nephrectomy on [**2575-8-15**].  Her
   post op course was complicated by agitation thought due to narcotics.
   Today, she was restarted on her home meds and while on telemetry, pt
   was noted to be bradycardic to 40s.  Pt was triggered for SBP of 70 and
   HR of 40 during which she remained asymptomatic.  She was given 1L IVF
   and her HR/BP trended back up to baseline.  However, there was a second
   event an hour later when she sat up and became bradycardic in the 30s
   with associated hypotension. Second episode occurred with position change
   and again, pt developped junctional rhythm in 30s. 
   
   home meds:
   Verapamil 240mg daily
   Lisinopril 5mg
   Rosuvastatin 10mg
